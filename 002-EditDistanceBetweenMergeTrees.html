            Topological structures such as the merge tree provide an abstract and succinct representation of scalar fields. They facilitate
            effective visualization and interactive exploration of feature-rich data. A merge tree captures the topology of sub-level and super-level
            sets in a scalar field. Estimating the similarity between merge trees is an important problem with applications to feature-directed
            visualization of time-varying data. We present an approach based on tree edit distance to compare merge trees. The comparison
            measure satisfies metric properties, it can be computed efficiently, and the cost model for the edit operations is both intuitive and
            captures well-known properties of merge trees. Experimental results on time-varying scalar fields, 3D cryo electron microscopy data,
            shape data, and various synthetic datasets show the utility of the edit distance towards a feature-driven analysis of scalar fields.

          <div class="problem-label">Summary</div>
          <p>Let $(\mathbb{X},f)$ be a 2-dimensional scalar field. We define the merge tree $M$ of $(\mathbb{X},f)$ by defining an equivalence relation similar to a Reeb graph except instead of looking at the level sets of $f$, we look at the sub-level sets $(-\infty, a]$. The merge tree (or join tree) is a well-defined tree. Let $T$ be a rooted tree with vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$. In addition, we have a label set $\Sigma$ and a character $\lambda \notin \Sigma$ which represents the null or empty character, which corresponds to a 'gap'.</p>
          <p>Defines an Edit distance whose goal is to be stable (less than maximum function distance) and discriminative (distance is always greater than bottleneck distance). The three elementary operations they use are
            <ul>
              <li><i>Relabel:</i> A relabel $a \rightarrow b$ corresponds to changing the label $a$ is changed to the label $b$</li>
              <li><i>Insertion:</i> An insert operation $\lambda \rightarrow b$ inserts a node $n$ with label $b$ as a child of another node $m$ by moving all children of node $m$ to be childrend of the new node $n$</li>
              <li><i>Deletion:</i> A deletion operation $a \rightarrow \lambda$ removes a node $n$ with label $a$ and all the children of node $n$ are now children of the parent node of $n$ ($parent(n)$).</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>Note that we have not yet defnied a labeling on the merge trees. </p>
          <p>We define an <i>Edit Distance Mapping</i> as being a triple $(M_e,T_1,T_2)$, where $T_1$ and $T_2$ are two trees and $M_e$ is a collection of ordered pairs $(i,j)$. Furthermore, $t_1$ and $t_2$ are labelings of the nodes in $T_1$ and $T_2$. Lastly, the pairs in $M_e$ satisfy the following:
            <ul>
              <li>$i_1 = i_2$ iff $j_1 = j_2$</li>
              <li>$t_1[i_1]$ is an ancestor of $t_1[i_2]$ iff $t_2[j_1]$ is an ancestor of $t_2[j_2]$.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </div>

      </div>
      <div class="page">
        <p>Then, the cost of transforming $T_1$ into $T_2$ would be the cost of all changes from $i$ to $j$, as well as the deletion of $i$ if there exists no corresponding $j$ and insertion of $j$ if there exists no corresponding $i$. We call this the cost of $M_e$, denoted as $\gamma(M_e)$. Minimizing this cost over every possible edit mappings has been shown to be NP-complete. Thus, we seek to constrain these problems to make them contractible.</p>
        <p>Since the information encoded in merge trees is very specific, this limits the number of operations we can do. For example, if we were to delete a minima which connects to a saddle above and that saddle connects to no other minima, then this tree will now have a saddle as a leaf, which is no longer a merge tree. Thus, to make this correct, we sometimes need to delete minima and connecting saddles in pairs.</p>
        <p>When measuring the edit distance, one issue that is encountered is small perturbations in the data set can lead to large differences in the cost. Consider two saddles that are have close function value. If the order of the saddles were reversed, then the pairings between these saddles and the minima below also changes. Since the edit cost is dependent on these persistence pairs, the edit cost is drastically affected. To alleviate this, they introduce a parameter $\varespilon$ which is known as the <i>stability parameter</i>. Before running the edit cost algorithm, each merge tree is run to a stabalizing algroithm where two saddles that are within $\varepsilon$ of each other are merged into a single saddle (bottom up).</p>
        <p>We can now define the set of costs we assign for merge trees. These costs are dependent on the persistence of these features. Let $p$ and $q$ be nodes in $T_1$ and $T_2$, respectively. Then, $p$ and $q$ are creators or destroyers of features in the merge trees. Let $(b_p,d_p)$ and $(b_q,d_q)$ be the birth and death times of these associated features, respectively. These can be represented as coordinates in the persistence diagram or as intervals on persistence barcodes.</p>
        <p>We define the $L_{\infty} \text{ cost } C_W$ as follows: 
          \begin{align}\gamma(p \rightarrow q) = & \min\begin{cases}\max\{|b_q-b_p|,|d_q-d_p|\}, \\ & \\ \frac{|d_p-b_p|+|d_q-b_q|}{2}\end{cases} \\ & \\ \gamma(p\rightarrow \lambda) = & \frac{|d_p-b_p|}{2} \\ & \\ \gamma(\lambda \rightarrow q) = & \frac{|d_q-b_q|}{2}\end{align}
        </p>
        <p>Essentailly, to relabel $p$ as $q$, we take the minimum of the largest discrepency in birth or death time and the sum of half the distances from the diagonal of the persistence diagram. To remove $p$ or insert $q$, we just take half the distance from the diagonal.</p>
        <p>We defined the $\text{ Overhange Cost } C_O$ as follows:
          \begin{align}\gamma(p \rightarrow q) = & \min\begin{cases}|b_q-b_p|+|d_q-d_p|, \\ & \\ |d_p-b_p|+|d_q-b_q|\end{cases} \\ & \\ \gamma(p\rightarrow \lambda) = & |d_p-b_p| \\ & \\ \gamma(\lambda \rightarrow q) = & |d_q-b_q|\end{align}
        </p>
        <p>Turns out that $C_W$ is a metric.</p>

          <p>Edit distance can be shown to be more discriminative than both the bottleneck distance of persistence diagrams and functional distortion distance between Reeb graphs. Because of this, I believe it is automatically more discriminative than the interleaving distance between Reeb graphs. Check the "strong equivalence of functional distortion distance and interleaving distance" paper to check .</p>

          <div class="problem-label">Computational Contributions</div>
          <p>Algorithm for finding the tree edit mappings is described in "A constrained edit distance between unordered labeled trees" by K. Zhang, where they then applied the discuessed edit costs. The inputs are two merge trees stabalized (see stabalization above). Note that the mappings created by the algorithm are depending on the choice of cost functions.</p>
