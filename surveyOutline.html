        <div style="font-size:1.75em;font-weight:600">Terminology</div>
        <p><b>Definition:</b> When we say that a metric $d_M$ is <i>stable</i>, we imply that $d_M(f,g) \leq ||f-g||_{\infty}$. In this case, $f$ and $g$ are the functions corresponding to two scalar fields $(\mathbb{X},f)$ and $(\mathbb{X},g)$. Note that in this case, it only makes sense to have $f$ and $g$ defined on the same domain. Furthermore, $f$ and $g$ in $d_M$ are assumed to be "encoded properly". By this, we mean that if the distance measure $M$ is defined on Reeb graphs, then the input to $d_M$ are the Reeb graphs corresponding to the functions $f,g$. This might help us decode statements like $d_I(f,g) \geq d_B(f,g)$, where $I$ refers to the interleaving distance of Reeb graphs and $B$ refers to the bottleneck distance between persistence diagrams.</p>
        <p>While this ambiguous notation might help keep things short in some situations, it is important to know that the interleaving distance has varying definitions depending on Reeb Graphs/Persistence modules, and Bottleneck Distance also has varying degrees as well</p>
        <p><b>Definition:</b> We say that a metric is $d_M$ is <i>discriminative</i> if $d_M(f,g) \geq d_B(f,g)$, where $B$ is the bottleneck distance between persistence diagrams.</p>

        <div style="font-size:1.75em;font-weight:600;">Questions</div>
        <p style="color:red">In terms of density of this document, how much should we dive into the definitions of interleaving, functional distortion, and edit distance? My personal opinion is to put as much information for the interleaving distance that allows a reader to use this document as a source to actually understand how the distance works. In this case, we'd need to define some information from category theory and then go into pre-cosheafs. I think this can be done in a reasonably sized piece (ignoring constructibility).</p>
        <p style="color:red;">The other idea is to defer the reader to more intense information, but I think that kind of defeats the purpose of the document. If we're going to have examples for each of the distances, the definitions should be pretty rigorous, IMO </p>
        <p style="color:red;">In general, I think it is wise to make sure this document can serve as a central location for definitions of these structures since the goal is to compare them so heavily.</p>
        <p style="color:red;">Maybe I'm thinking of this survey too broadly, though. To me, it almost feels like it would be a "manual" or like the a section in a textbook. I'm not sure if that's good or bad.</p>

        <div style="font-size:1.75em;font-weight:600;">Notes</div>
        <p>Introduction should explain who I'm serving with this survey</p>
        <p>Same running example through 3 through 7</p>
        <p>For applications, want to point out (1) what people have done with comparing top structures, (2) what could we do if we had these distances available (3) what is close to these distance in terms of use case</p>
        <p>For applications, (1) should be in introduction while (2) and possibly (3) are more aspirational and can be in the last section</p>
        <p>Representation might change computational bounds (simplicial complex vs mesh)</p>

        <!-- <div>
          Intuitively, this scalar field has a form where between critical points, each fiber is homotopic <note>check this</note> to other fibers in that same area. For example, if we take a torus standing on its end, where the function $f$ just maps to its height, then taking a fiber from the middle would be two circles. Now, as we adjust the value of the fiber (slightly) up or down, as long as we don't cross another critical point, the circles will still be "two circles", albeit closer or farther apart, in a sense. Note that in this scenario, the non-critical fibers can be thought of as two circles that are separated from one another (see disposition on tangent cirlces)  So, if our critical fiber is a figure-eight, then we can map each individual circle to respective circles of the figure-eight. If instead we had a single circle for the non-critical fiber, we'd still have a continuous map to the figure-eight by indentifying a pair of points of the circle that form a diameter as being the same two points. Then we simply have the quotient map (which is continuous) <note> why is this continous again? think about the open subset of a figure-eight and why it HAS to be a ball, not just an interval. It must have to do with the topology that is defined on the figure-eight (which must be the quotient topology)</note>. 
        </div> -->


      <!-- <div class="page">
        <div> But if we had to map from the figure-eight to the circle or two circles, it would be non-continuous because you'd have to break up that center piece. Critical fibers are the only places where figure-eight like shapes are possible, so mapping to them should be no problem.
        </div>
        <div>Depending on the scenario, there are different ways to construct these attaching maps. In the 2-manifold with a Morse function case, our attaching maps can be defined by the <i>gradient flow</i>. For every point $x \in \mathbb{M}$, we have a gradient. A <i>flow</i> is a function $\gamma : \mathbb{M} \times \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{M}$ such that for all $x \in \mathbb{M}$, $\gamma(x,0) = x$ and $\gamma(\gamma(x,t),s)  = \gamma(x,t+s)$. The gradient shows us which direction to go in, basically. We can imagine a set of vectors on our manifold showing us where the flow lines are. </div>

      <!-- <div class="page">
        <div class="section"><div class="title">Disposition on Tangent Cylinders</div></div>
        <div>
          We can have "tangent cylinders" in this case. The non-critical fibers are simply homotopic to figure eights. At the critical fibers on either side, there <i>must</i> be a figure-eight shape (or more tangent circles) so that we don't have to split up the figure-eight. This is to be expected though, because the critical fibers are points where things join or separate.
