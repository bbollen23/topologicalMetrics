            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Motivate the problem with references to applications of finding distance between topological structures (persistence diagrams, merge trees etc.). Furthermore, introduce motivation of scalar field analysis along with some approaches taken to finding similarity in scalar fields.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Preliminary Definitions</h3>
            <p>Section devoted to defining scalar fields / $\mathbb{R}$-spaces, Reeb graphs, persistence, extended persistence, levelset zigzag persistence. I intend to make this section so that I only provide basic definitions and leave the details to the references for where these are defined.</p>
            <p>Section should also include definition of bottleneck distance. Furthermore, since we are comparing bottleneck distance to the other metrics, I think we can introduce our standard example of a pair scalar fields / $\mathbb{R}$-spaces here and show the bottleneck distance between their corresponding persistence diagrams.</p>

            <h3>Interleaving Distance</h3>
            <div>
              History
              <p>Short history of interleaving distance and when it was introduced for Reeb Graphs</p>

            <div>
              Definition of Interleaving Distance
              <p>Also making sure this definition is concise (no category theory, no formal definition of pre-cosheafs)</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              Example(s)
              <p>Interleaving distance of the standardized pair(s) of Reeb graphs resulting from the pair of scalar fields introduced in section 2. This pair of Reeb graphs will be used as the examples for functional distortion distance and edit distance as well.</p>

            <h3>Comparison of Distances</h3>
            <div>General Distance Comparison Diagram
              <p>Not only is a general diagram for this useful for reference, but it will also be helpful to the reader to help guide them through the list of results.</p>
            </div>
            <div>List of Stability Results (vs $L^{\infty}$)
              <p>Not sure if this will take up much space since each metric is stable and I don't plan to reiterate the proofs.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              List of Discriminative Results (vs Bottleneck)
              <p>Many works use the phrase "more discriminative than bottleneck distance" to refer to the fact that these metrics are often bounded below by the bottleneck distance. However, some of these papers are referencing different versions of persistence diagrams. I think this will be a good opportunity to be more explicit about how we determine the bottleneck distance between two Reeb graphs (Is it bottleneck distance between 0-dimensional persistence diagrams of the scalar fields or is it bottleneck distance on levelset persistence?)</p>

            <div>
              List of Comparison between each other

            <h3>Computation</h3>
            <div>
              Complexity Results
              <p>Statements for the complexity classes of each distance. No plan to delve into the details of the complexity proofs.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              Approximations
              <p>For this section, I would discuss any approximations (if any) to these distances. I will reserve disussion of these distances on different structures for later (interleaving distance on merge trees, for example).</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              Implementations
              <p>If any, I would like to provide resources for implementations of these distances. Even though each of this are in NP, small scale implementations can still be useful for understanding of the metrics.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Alternatives To Reeb Graphs</h3>
            <p>At this point, since we discussed the computational difficulties of these metrics, it would be nice to discuss structures similar to Reeb graphs where the distances are either easier to compute or easier to approximate</p>
            <div>Merge Trees
              <p>State results for bottleneck distance being equal to the interleaving distance. Also discuss the edit distance defined on merge trees which is tractable (from "Edit Distance Between Merge Trees" by </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Applications</h3>
            <p>In this section, I would like to attempt to answer a couple of questions: (1) If these metrics are available to use, what applications could they be used for, (2) which distances are close to these ones in terms of what they're used for.</p>
            <p>To discuss question (1), we will want to look at the results from seciton 8.4 to better understand what situations would be better suited for different distances.</p>

        <!-- <div>
          Intuitively, this scalar field has a form where between critical points, each fiber is homotopic <note>check this</note> to other fibers in that same area. For example, if we take a torus standing on its end, where the function $f$ just maps to its height, then taking a fiber from the middle would be two circles. Now, as we adjust the value of the fiber (slightly) up or down, as long as we don't cross another critical point, the circles will still be "two circles", albeit closer or farther apart, in a sense. Note that in this scenario, the non-critical fibers can be thought of as two circles that are separated from one another (see disposition on tangent cirlces)  So, if our critical fiber is a figure-eight, then we can map each individual circle to respective circles of the figure-eight. If instead we had a single circle for the non-critical fiber, we'd still have a continuous map to the figure-eight by indentifying a pair of points of the circle that form a diameter as being the same two points. Then we simply have the quotient map (which is continuous) <note> why is this continous again? think about the open subset of a figure-eight and why it HAS to be a ball, not just an interval. It must have to do with the topology that is defined on the figure-eight (which must be the quotient topology)</note>. 
        </div> -->


      <!-- <div class="page">
        <div> But if we had to map from the figure-eight to the circle or two circles, it would be non-continuous because you'd have to break up that center piece. Critical fibers are the only places where figure-eight like shapes are possible, so mapping to them should be no problem.
        </div>
        <div>Depending on the scenario, there are different ways to construct these attaching maps. In the 2-manifold with a Morse function case, our attaching maps can be defined by the <i>gradient flow</i>. For every point $x \in \mathbb{M}$, we have a gradient. A <i>flow</i> is a function $\gamma : \mathbb{M} \times \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{M}$ such that for all $x \in \mathbb{M}$, $\gamma(x,0) = x$ and $\gamma(\gamma(x,t),s)  = \gamma(x,t+s)$. The gradient shows us which direction to go in, basically. We can imagine a set of vectors on our manifold showing us where the flow lines are. </div>

      <!-- <div class="page">
        <div class="section"><div class="title">Disposition on Tangent Cylinders</div></div>
        <div>
          We can have "tangent cylinders" in this case. The non-critical fibers are simply homotopic to figure eights. At the critical fibers on either side, there <i>must</i> be a figure-eight shape (or more tangent circles) so that we don't have to split up the figure-eight. This is to be expected though, because the critical fibers are points where things join or separate.
